abstract: This paper proposes an automatic construction technique of transferable loading algorithms based on Cartesian Genetic Programming. The proposed method aims to construct the loading algorithm with a few hundred fitness evaluations by optimizing the execution order of rules to decide a type of multiple cardboard boxes and their loadable positions simultaneously. Experimental results show that auto-constructed loading algorithms can derive competitive performances to defined baselines under two hundred fitness evaluations on similar problems without any additional fitness evaluation.
