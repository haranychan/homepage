### Message

I'm trying to figure out how to separate my hobby from my research in my homepage... I don't know whether to make them separate pages, separate them in the header menu, or just separate the folders for posts... I'd like to report on the activities of the civic orchestra I belong to after graduating from the university orchestra, but I think I'd like my homepage to be mainly about my research.

I am very honored to have been selected through a video audition to attend a [**Piano Master Class**](https://yamato-bunka.jp/hall/2021/007506.html) given by Mr. Yuya Tsuda, a pianist and A/P at Tokyo University of the Arts! I'm still worried that it's some kind of mistake... I'm also happy that I'll be playing Steinway & Sons D-274 in the main hall.

A master class is like an open lesson, and is a rare opportunity to be taught by a front-line professional player. The general public is welcome to attend as an auditing student (although you are an auditing student, there are no reports to write, so don't worry!) I hope you will come to the master class if you can make it. For more details, please check the images.

The piece I am going to take a lesson on is **the first movement of L.v.Beethoven's Piano Sonata No.23 "Appassionata"**, one of Beethoven's three major piano sonatas (the others are "Pathetique" and "Moonlight"). The title "Appassionata" was given by a publisher, not by Beethoven himself. My favorite points of this work are Beethoven's unceasing passion during the period when he was suffering from deafness, but was able to create many masterpieces, the large scale of the work using the latest piano of the time (68 keys), and the development of scenes that change one after another. 

I would like to thank the piano teacher who have guided me this far, Mr. Tsuda, the piano teacher, those who organize the event, and those who come to the event, and I would like to enjoy it to the fullest!
