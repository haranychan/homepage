## Message

Hello, everyone. I'm Kei NISHIHARA, a master's degree student at Yokohama National University.

Today, I'm happy to announce that my new personal website has been up ðŸŽ‰

This site is mainly about my research, but sometimes about my hobbies.

For now, I have posted [Publications](/publication/), [Awards](/#awards), and [Grants & Scholarships](/#grants) as well as [Bio at home](/), please check them out!

I will continue to update this page regularly, so please stay tuned!
